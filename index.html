                    A data-driven, factual analysis of the current state of the world economy and its hopes for a better world
                </p>
                <div id='full-summary'>
                    <p>This book touches a whole variety of topics from start to finish. The title of the book might be deceiving for many as it doesn’t only talk about economy, but the politics surrounding it, the individuals being affected by it, the whole global community and humanity itself. </p>
                    <p>What I was mostly astonished by while reading this book is how two very capable economists are so in touch with the individuals within the gargantuan economy of countries. They emphasize heavily on the wellbeing of individuals, be it via ways to reduce income, wealth inequality, providing basic necessities and even mentioning about preserving their dignity and sense of pride. I always thought economists were experts in their own field, running numbers through potential scenarios to calculate possible economic gain or loss, without much regard for potential disastrous consequences of their policies. However, these two, as their Nobel Prize winning reason suggests, are more than acknowledging the individuals and especially those who stand to lose with certain policies. </p>
                    <p>This brings the book to chapters such as trade, globalization, immigration and automatization. They explain the trend that has been going around the globe and how they are inevitable, doing good for most people but highlight the fact that there are indeed people who are losing out and suffering due to these occurrences. Instead of blaming them like most politicians for their violence, ignorance and lack of intelligence, the authors shine some light into their plight and helps the reader understand why there is the apparent divide between groups of people. This inevitably brings in the story of the rise of nationalism and populism in the political stage and how the rise has been in the making for several years now.</p>
                    <p>The book also goes and attempts to answer some of the society’s important question such as ‘should we help the poor even though it might make them lazy’ or ‘should we raise taxes for a more inclusive growth?’. Now these questions have very contrasting views and are at the forefront of political arguments and protests. However, these two take a scientific approach to the questions, citing numbers and figures and their own experiment to prove their points. I believe we all can appreciate the effort they put into this scientific approach, especially in a world where a single, passionate statement, albeit lacking evidence, can cause massive stirring in the online community and lay the foundation for miscommunication and false information.</p>
                    <p>They go further to show that this miscommunication and stirring of words by politicians and influencers are mostly false and used passionately to sway the general opinion to their own favor and plead that the public should be more careful and suspicious of their politicians when it comes to speeches, declarations and reasoning. </p>
                    <p>In the final chapters of this book, they slowly start to suggest the hope they have for humanities’ society, which is a fair and inclusive one, where every individual is not left behind, ignored and cared for, with dignity. The word ‘dignity’ gets used a lot by the authors and rightfully so, for the current state of the world has forgotten to acknowledge those getting left behind and often realize too late that these people are also human beings who are seeking acceptance and have the right to be treated with respect and dignity. The authors also emphasise that when helping these people, one should not carry it out with a condescending tone, but with a more helpful, compassionate tone. The more I read, the more I resonate with the author’s views and their eventual hopes for humanity.</p>
                    <p>Even though the whole book was filled with the current gloomy state of division, hatred across different groups of people and misuse of information by leaders of the world to sway public opinion and divide the public, the end was filled with hope and a strong foundation where we can start to rebuild this broken world. </p>

                <p id='quotes'>Some remarkable quotes
                    <ul>
                        <li>Democracy and live with dissent, as long as there is respect on both sides. But respect demands some understanding.</li>
                        <li>Those lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time, with the right skills or the right ideas, grew wealthy.</li>
                        <li>To the extent we are all benefitting from trade, we should collectively pay for the cost. It makes no sense to ask agricultural workers to lose their jobs just so steelworkers can keep theirs.</li>
                        <li>Prejudice is often a defensive reaction to the many things we feel are going wrong int he world, our economic travails, and a sense that we are no longer respected or valued.</li>
                    </ul>
